:wave:

I want to write some letters. Like what the New Testament is made up of but probably not so ... revered. Famous? You know, not part of the actual cannon of scripture. Mostly I want to explore the gifting Yahweh has given me and need to find an appropriate outlet for the result of hearing from him.
