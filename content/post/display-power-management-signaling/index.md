More tips from strangers on the internet. 

I joined a Discord server which is not something I would normally do. The problem I face in life is that I am surrounded by creative people but very few of them are in to text configuration files. For some reason I am not sure why.

Well, one day I was talking to some folk and found out about [Display Power Management Signaling](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Display_Power_Management_Signaling). I know right! When I was in Mac land I would regularly sleep my display which would trigger the lock screen so I could go make a cup of tea. I wasn't sure how to do the same on Linux. I didn't want to put the machine to sleep or hibernation or whatever because that was chunky to start back up again. Not to mention sometimes my wifi wouldn't come back on.

`xset dpms force off && slock`

With these commands I am that bit closer to my old habbit. Thanks hexDSL!
