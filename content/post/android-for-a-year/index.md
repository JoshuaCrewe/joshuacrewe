I can often get a bit single minded about things. I can see it happening when I get an idea in my head and I start to go in on myself to follow the thought through. Recently it has been the idea of switching to more open source platforms and software. I recently got a hold of [actual hardware to run Linux on](https://www.joshuacrewe.co.uk/post/linux-at-last/) which had been someone I had wanted to do for a long time. 

On the subject of phones, I traditionally never wanted a smart phone. One of my favourite phones I have ever owned was [the Nokia 5140](https://www.gsmarena.com/nokia_5140-587.php) on the basis that I could do what I wanted with it and it wouldn't break. When the iPhone came along I was using a [Blackberry Pearl](https://www.gsmarena.com/blackberry_pearl_3g_9105-3287.php). It was smart enough that you could check your email if you really wanted to but mostly the hardware keyboard meant that it was most pleasant to type on than the software keyboards we use today.

# A bit of history

I succumbed to my first iPhone when I got married. My wife was using a phone she called "Bepe" which was a flip phone she had due to losing the newer one she got on contract. We were getting married and I wanted us to be able to take photos and share them more easily. The iPhone 4 was cheap and readily available. I had this idea that because there were so many of them it would be cheap and easy to repair which would make them last longer.

These phones got slower and slower until we upgraded to the iPhone 5c when our first children were born. Again I wanted to be able to take and share photos of our new children more easily.

But I have not been happy with my phone since the Blackberry Pearl. A big part of me wishes that I never got into the smart phone game or if I did it was for fun instead of a lack of choice.

# What about Android

I have never considered Android to be a viable option for several reasons (not necessarily good reasons).

1. We have always used Apple as a family, I didn't know anything else
2. It didn't seem as nice to look at. Widgets? nope.
3. I do not want any Google.

Over the years I have been able to explore outside of Apple and have really enjoyed that experience. The look of Android is subjective and flexible. You don't have to have the widgets and looks are not everything. Google is the trickiest of the lot.

# A Googleless Android ?

The question I asked one day was, is it possible to have Android without Google? The answer I have come to terms with is, not really. Not really but it might be enough where it counts. I found out that Android is built on the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) which you can download and use. Google are the biggest contributor to this project but it is still Open Source. Not using Google is hard task so I needed to make some rules. I am trying to not use Google in general but I draw the line when the project is free and open source. So Gmail is a no go. Google Analytics, nope. The Go programming language, fine. In theory AOSP should be OK as long as Google Service are not involved.

# LineageOS

Enter [LineageOs](https://lineageos.org/) which describes itself as "A free and open-source operating system for various devices, based on the Android mobile platform". This seems OK right? The most important aspect of using this custom ROM is that there is no Google search bar on the home screen.
